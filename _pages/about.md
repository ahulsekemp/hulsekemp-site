_The Hulse-Kemp Lab is part of the USDA ARS [Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/stoneville-ms/genomics-and-bioinformatics-research/people/amanda-hulse-kemp//)_

We are located in the [Department of Crop and Soil Sciences](https://cals.ncsu.edu/crop-and-soil-sciences/), [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu/) in Raleigh, North Carolina.

_Our Research_

**Genomics, Breeding, Computational Biology, and Bioinformatics** 

The research in our lab focuses on biological questions which can be answered with computational and informatics analyses. We are particularly interested in resource development and integration of genomic and biotechnology tools and references which can benefit breeders, such as high-quality reference genome sequences. We study a large range of agronomically important crops such as cotton, spinach, pepper, coffee, and tomato as well as animals and pests.

### Research Areas
* Development of high-quality refrence genomes
* High-throughput genotyping platforms
* Trait mapping and identification
* Integration of advanced technologies into breeding programs
* Assimilating interdisciplinary research teams
