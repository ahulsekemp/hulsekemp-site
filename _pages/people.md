## Grant Billings, MS
_MS, Clemson University_

Grant Billings is a Bioinformatics Ph.D. student in the Hulse-Kemp Lab from Florence, South Carolina. His research interests are improving the usability of existing genomic resources and making accessible genome-based tools for upland cotton breeders. He hopes to combine his experience in field-based plant breeding, laboratory research, computational analysis, and genetics to assist breeders in their quest to discover better cotton through conventional breeding with a modern twist. Grant completed an M.S. in Plant & Environmental Sciences from Clemson University working on a cotton breeding project under the supervision of Dr. Mike Jones and Dr. Todd Campbell. He earned his B.S. in Crop & Soil Sciences from Michigan State University where he did tissue culture and greenhouse plant maintenance with the potato breeding program. In his free time, Grant likes to enjoy live music and experiment with food. Grant is currently supported by a Cotton Incorporated Fellowship.
