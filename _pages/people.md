## Daniel Restrepo-Montoya, PhD
_PhD - North Dakota State University; MEng, BS - Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Bogotá, Col_

Daniel is a biologist with a master’s degree in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Genomics and Bioinformatics. A former fellow of the Fulbright program, he has knowledge and expertise in the analysis and handling of biological data through the application of mathematical and informatics tools and experience working with research groups that specialize in different biological problems

## Emily Delorean, PhD
Emily is a [NSF postdoctoral fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2010930&HistoricalAwards=false) in Amanda’s lab. In collaboration with Will Rutter (USDA-ARS), they are leveraging de novo genome assemblies to study the genetic basis of the root-knot nematode virulence on chili peppers and correspondingly, the genetic resistance of chili peppers against root-knot nematodes. The goal of the work is to help us breed chili pepper varieties with durable genetic resistance to root-knot nematodes. Emily likes teaching, talking about science over beer or cupcakes, and kittens.

## Keo Corak, PhD
_PhD, MS - University of Wisconsin, Madison; BA - Macalester College_

Keo is a USDA/ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow for the USDA  SCINet Scientific
computing initiative.

## Ashley Schoonmaker
Ashley is a Bioinformatics PhD student with Dr. Amanda Hulse-Kemp and Dr. Susana Milla-Lewis at North Carolina State University.  Her primary area of research lies in the development of genetic tools for crop breeders and QTL analysis for resistance to diseases, which includes projects in cotton, St. Augustinegrasses and bermudagrasses.

## Grant Billings, MS
_MS - Clemson University; BS - Michigan State University_


Grant is a Bioinformatics Ph.D. studentin the Hulse-Kemp Lab from Florence, South Carolina. His research interests are improving the usability of existing genomic resources and making accessible genome-based tools for upland cotton breeders. He hopes to combine his experience in field-based plant breeding, laboratory research, computational analysis, and genetics to assist breeders in their quest to discover better cotton through conventional breeding with a modern twist. In his free time, Grant likes to enjoy live music and experiment with food. Grant is currently supported by a Cotton Incorporated Fellowship.
