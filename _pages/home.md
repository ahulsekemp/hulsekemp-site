Our research group is part of the US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Research Service, Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Unit, a distributed
unit with four locations in the Southeast Area. We are based out of Raleigh, North Carolina.

GBRU-Gainesville works broadly in machine learning, software, and microbiome
science across application domains. Thse applications include animal health, crop improvement,
nutrition, and natural resource conservation.
